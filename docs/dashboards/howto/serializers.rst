Serializers
==========

Serializers allow you to easily turn your data into something which can be rendered by a component,
They help remove much of the boiler plate code which goes into fetching the data, manipulating it into something
which can be understood and then passing it back.

Wild coeus provides 2 serializers out the box; one for Charts and the other for Tables.
