        css of SCSS can then be used to layout vis a grid-template.

        It would also be possible to do this via the component ids e.g. which would be easier to follow
        until the dashboard changes. TODO allow this to be done in the python code also.

            grid-area: text_component

                "f f e"
                "f f d"
